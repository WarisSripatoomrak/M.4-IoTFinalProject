# IoT Apple Watch Project: COVID-19 Cases Reporter Application in Bangkok, Thailand Using API

  This was a project for my Computer and Technology class in Secondary 4 where I got to choose any IoT items in my house to do any project with, I chose my Apple Watch Series 2. I didn't know what to do with my project, but then I decided to make an app.
  
  I had my helper with me. I would be lying if I said that I did all of the coding as I didn't know how to code with Swift, so I started to get to the basics first. The huge problem here is the due date, the project is due at the end of the month. The application would be way more complex than the basics I had been learning. So my helper decided to teach me how to code the app straight to the point, I learnt what an API is, different files we need to use, and some Swift functions, all that good stuff.
  
  I could say that that was the first time I had a real experience with codes, it was a steep learning curve, but I've managed to make it work. The appreciation for computers sprung up from that point on.
  
  I cannot thank my helper, my teacher, and all the way to Apple enough for dedicating their precious time to inspire me.
